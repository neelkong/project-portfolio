Collection of my work



Hi! Welcome to my project portfolio. 

In the AI Projects folder, I have included all projects I worked on during my CS188 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Club.

All other folders are an array of projects from many different areas I have worked on. 

**Ants**: A parody of the classic mobile game, Plants vs. Zombies. I used Object Oriented Programming with the Python coding language to make a game in which the player
operates as the Ants. The goal is to strategically place down ants to ward off incoming waves of Bees.

**Cats**: I used the Python coding language to a detailed, working typing test. It allows the user to insert a body of text and take a typing test with it. Afterwards, 
the player receives various statistics about their performance like words per minute and accuracy.

*Also implemented an auto-correct feature that predicts what word the user is trying to type.

**Hog**: A game in which a player can play against the program or two players can play eachother. A program that simulates a game of old-fashioned hog in which players
bet points and roll the dice. I used the Python programming language to produce this.

**Proj0**: Used Java to develop a game modeled after the mobile game 2048. The player is able to rotate a board 90 degrees eachother direction and consequently shift
the numbered blocks on the board. It follows the classic rules of 2048 and has keyboard input implemented.

**Proj1**: Used Java to create a new data structure from scratch. I recreated the array deque with several innovative strategies. For example, I included the implementation
of circular arrays with sentinel nodes. This means when a user is iterating through the deque, if it searches for the next node when at the node located at the end of
the data structure, the user is taken back to the beginning.

**Proj2**: This is my most impressive project. I have spent the most time on it and am the most proud of it. I used Java to develop a localized Git Version Control system
that supports every feature included on the github website including global logs, commits, branching, hashing, adding, and removing from the stage. 

**Proj2-cs61classify**: I got more practice using low level ARM programming languages. Specifically, I use RISC-V to make a program to handle various operations regarding matrix math
like finding the dot product of two matrices or multiplying two matrices together. 

**Proj3**: I used Java to create a video game in which the player explores a world that is randomly generated using a seed input. It has advanced layouts of terrain like
tunnels, rooms, and teleporters. There are also certain squares that provide the player with points when they step on them. The end goal of the video game is for the player
to discover the exit.

**Proj3-cs61cpu**: I used Logism to build the bit mechanics and processing for the Central Processing Unit (CPU) of a computer. I implemented everything like the ALU, Memory, 
Immediate generation, and ability to choose inputs.

**Scheme**: Used Python to develop a live Scheme interpreter. The program takes in scheme commands and processes them using python to perform the correct results.
